my favourite linux commands are:-

1.echo: Prints text or strings to the standard output or redirects them to a file.
2.touch: Creates new, empty files or updates the access/modification timestamps of existing files.
3.cd: Changes the current directory, allowing navigation through the file system.
4.sudo = “superuser do” → runs a command with administrator (root) privileges.  
  su = “switch user” → by default, switches to the root user.
5.cp: Copies files or directories from one location to another.

My history commands:-

1.sudo apt nmap
2.sudo apt-get install nmap
3.ls
4.yum install nmap
5.git clone https://github.com/nmap/nmap.git
